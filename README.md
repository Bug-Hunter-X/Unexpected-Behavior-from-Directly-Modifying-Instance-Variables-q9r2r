This example demonstrates a potential issue in Ruby when directly manipulating instance variables using `instance_variable_set` instead of using accessor methods. Directly modifying instance variables can bypass any validation or logic within the class's methods, potentially leading to inconsistencies and unexpected behavior. The solution showcases the use of accessor methods for better encapsulation and maintainability.
